// 1. Write a function, functionCaller, that takes a function (myCallback) and a number as parameters. The functionCaller returns myCallback called with the number (as an argument).

var myCallback = function(number) {
    console.log("The number I recieved was " + number);
};

var functionCaller = function(func, number) {
    func(number);
};

functionCaller(myCallback, 235);


// 2. You give a friend 50p to get you something form the shop.
//
// Write a function getSomethingFromTheShop, that takes in budget (as a string) and a callback function.

var getSomethingFromTheShop = function(budget, cFunc) {

    console.log("I have " + budget + " to go to the shop with.");

    cFunc("Cheese", "Potatoes");

};


getSomethingFromTheShop("Â£5.23", function (req, res) {console.log("I wanted " + req + " from the shop but I got " + res + " instead.");});
// Invoke the callback function inside getSomethingFromTheShop and pass it two arguments (what you wanted from the shop and what you actually got).
//
// Finally, invoke the getSomethingFromTheShop function by passing it a string for the budget and an anonymous function as the callback.
//
// The anonymous callback function should have two parameters - req and res. (standing for request and response).
//
// In the getSomethingFromTheShop function include console.log("I have " + budget + " to go to the shop"); In the anonymous function include console.log("I wanted a " + req + " but all I got was a " + res);
//
// 3. Maths Fun: Write two functions increment and square. increment should take in a number and return the number plus 1. square should take in a number and return it multiplied by itself.
//
// Write another function called doSomeMathsForMe that takes in a number (n) and a function (a callback) and executes the callback, passing in n as an argument.
//

var increment = function(n) {
    return n + 1;
};

var square = function(n) {
    return n * n;
};

var doSomeMathsForMe = function(n, method) {
    return method(n);
};


console.log(doSomeMathsForMe(5, square));

// Invoke doSomeMathsForMe by passing it a number and the increment and/or square function.
